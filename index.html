            <h3>A little something about me..</h3> 
                <!--Created Tretirary heading with descriptive paragraph-->
            <p>I am 27 years old and I reside in southern California. I have always been interested in
                technology but never could purse my interest due to me being in a lot of sports and extra curricular activities.
                I worked for hospitals for the last 7 years and I was ready for a new journey, something more challenging if you will,
                and what else could be better than into getting into code! I've made extra steps into becoming a part of a coding group
                where we dissect different projects together and bounce ideas off of one another. I'm always looking for new ways to network
                and improve my skill. I joined the Thinkful program in June of 2022 and I haven't looked back since.
            </p>
            <p> I am always looking to work with others on projects and share different ideas or insight.
                If looking for a new hire developer or a developers with integrity, please feel free to reach out to me,
                I look forward to your responses.
            </p>
